## 🏡 House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning  

### 🚀 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict **house prices** using **Machine Learning algorithms** based on features such as **square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, year built, and neighborhood**. The model assists real estate stakeholders in making **data-driven decisions**.  

### 📊 Dataset Information  
- **Records:** 50,000 houses  
- **Features:** Square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, neighborhood, year built  
- **Target:** House sale price  

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization  

### 📈 Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Removed outliers using IQR method  
   - Encoded categorical features (Neighborhood) using Label Encoding  
   - Scaled numerical features using Min-Max scaling  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Visualized price distributions and feature correlations  
   - Analyzed trends like square footage vs. price and year built vs. price  

3. **Model Training & Evaluation:**  
   - **Models Implemented:**  
     ✔️ Linear Regression  
     ✔️ Ridge Regression  
     ✔️ Decision Tree Regressor  
     ✔️ Gradient Boosting Regressor  
   - **Evaluation Metrics:** R² Score, MAE, MSE, RMSE  

### 📊 Model Performance  
| Model                | R² Score | MAE         | RMSE         |
|---------------------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Linear Regression   | 0.57     | $39,866    | $49,681     |
| Ridge Regression    | 0.57     | $39,866    | $49,680     |
| Decision Tree       | 0.56     | $40,026    | $49,886     |
| Gradient Boosting   | 0.57     | $39,890    | $49,730     |

### 💡 Key Insights  
- **Square footage** is the most significant predictor of house prices  
- **Neighborhood** has a strong impact on pricing trends  
- **Gradient Boosting** provides the best performance among non-linear models
